This is my project for Summer 2019.

Unfortunately, after working on it every day for about 2 months, I realized how big of a project I've created, 
and I had to leave it aside for a while. I love the concept and the design and because of that, I chose not to 
rush it nor reduce the quality of the content. I will for sure come back to it once I have the time.

Code is in C# and it should be organized in an understandable way. 
Also, this is my first practical implementation of object-oriented concept and encapsulation/abstraction after 
learning it from school!
