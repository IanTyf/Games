Start With White is my submission for Ludum Dare GameJam (Compo) 45.
Source code is provided here in C#.

--2019/10/17--
Since the competition has a time constraint of 48 hours, the code is pretty scrappy and optimizations are left undone.
After the competition grading period ends, I will make update to the game as well as the code.
